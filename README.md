# AI Respiratory Disease Analyzer Stethoscope - GUI Application

This repository provides an AI-powered application for analyzing respiratory diseases using stethoscope audio data. It features an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) designed to streamline audio data processing, analysis, and display of results.

## Features

- **Respiratory Sound Analysis:** Utilizes advanced machine learning models to classify and identify respiratory diseases from stethoscope recordings.
- **Intuitive GUI:** Developed with Python (and relevant libraries) for ease of use, visualization, and interaction.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Comprehensive notebooks (89% of codebase) for data exploration, preprocessing, and experimentation.
- **Core Implementation in Python & C++:** Python scripts for model development and evaluation (8.5% of codebase). C++ modules for optimized audio processing (2.4% of codebase).

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/` - Jupyter Notebooks for research, prototyping, and visualization.
- `src/` - Python scripts and modules for model training, prediction, and GUI logic.
- `cpp/` - C++ sources for performance-critical audio data processing.
- `data/` - Sample stethoscope audio recordings and datasets.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NhlanhlaPomba/Ai_Respiratory_Disease_Analyzer_Stethoscope_-_GUI_Application.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   - For Python components:  
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - For C++ components, refer to the `cpp/README.md`.

3. **Run notebooks:**
   - Start Jupyter Notebook and open any notebook under `notebooks/`.

4. **Start GUI application:**
   - Run the main Python script, typically found in `src/respiratory_app.py`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Relevant Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)
- C++ compiler (for building C++ modules)

## Usage

- Record or upload stethoscope audio data.
- Use the GUI to preprocess, analyze, and visualize predictions regarding respiratory diseases.
